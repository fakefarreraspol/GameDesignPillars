# Game Design Pillars

## What are game pillars?
Game pillars are the parameters that delimitate the process of production and design of our game. They are the fundamental basis of a game. <br />
Every game has different game pillars, depending on what de designers want to create, and these pillars will be the characteristics that the videogame will take more in consideration in its creation. <br />
Every game tend to have from 3 to 8 fundamental game pillars to be based on, pillars have to be respected when they are stablished.

</p> <br />
To create good game pillars that fit in our game we have to follow some steps: <br />
1: First, because we don't have ideas we have to do a Brain Storming to think about how our game can be.<br />
2: With the ideas from the brain Storming, we have to create three blocks<br />
   **Before Playing**: Things that the player will take in count, the art, ui...<br />
   **During game**: Gameplay, mechanics...<br />
   **After Playing**: Ideas related with replayability.<br />
3: Now we have to pass the idea through this filter:<br />

</p> <br />

4: At the end if the ideas could pass the filters, we have to ensure that these ideas are original.<br />
  Is the game pillar already on a game? If your answer is yes, then this pillar is declined.<br />
  

## Bad game Pillars

How can we identify if a pillar is bad? here are some examples of bad game pillars: <br />

**Empty words**: Every pillar has to answer the question "How can we do it?" if the answer is I don't know or something ambiguous, then this is a bad pillar. <br />
**Tasks**: Establishing a task as a Game design pillar, for example colorfull UI. Pllars must synthesize an idea brievely.<br />
**Technical Concepts**: Although we have to take in count technical concepts while designing, having one of them as a pillar is a bad idea.<br />
Others:<br />

</p> <br />

** How to not destroy a game
Game design is always changing and this means we will make changes and additions during the process: new mechanics, items, etc.<br />
-We have to be loyal to the game pillars or we will change completely the original design of the game.<br />
-If we make too many changes in our design, game may not be finished,<br />
-Everything we put has to be relevant on the game, we can't add something that has nothing to do we the game.<br />
-If we copy the pillars from an other game and want to change one we can destroy the game creating for example unbalance or non-working mechanics.<br />
